We conduct research to unravel the mechanisms of brain functions by measuring brain activities via electroencephalography and measuring cerebral blood flows. Moreover, we conduct research on brain-computer interface (BCI), a technology that bridges the brain with the outside world, by detecting people’s intentions from measured brain activities and directly encouraging the brain to learn from external cues. BCI will make possible a world in which people can manipulate machines by thinking about what they want them to do.

The technology to estimate people’s physical conditions from biological signals has attracted attention as a means of realizing biological sensing such as in communicating with patients with limb paralysis and preventing drivers from being involved in traffic accidents.

Analysis of the brain functions of memory, recognition and mobility by measuring brain activities

Estimation of people’s physiological and psychological conditions based on the measurement and analysis of minute biological signals

In my research, I aim to unravel the neural mechanisms underlying human visual perception and develop sophisticated machine learning methods to model and decode signals from the human brain. Combining these two efforts (i.e., artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience), I work towards assistive devices by advancing neurotechnological systems including (non-invasive) brain-computer interfacing, for instance for communication and control.
